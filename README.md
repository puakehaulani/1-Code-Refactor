# HoriSeon Refactor

**HoriSeon Refactor** is Homework 1 for UW Coding Bootcamp. We were instructed to take an existing index.html file and refactor it to make it more semantic, without it changing how the page displayed.  
This was an exercise to learn about semantic code, and practice a simple example of the type of real world refactoring assignments we could be given after graduation.

Before submission, I generated a Lighthouse report in ChromeDevTools and made further adjustments on the suggested changes for accessibility. The [report] is included in the repo.

All changes to the original code are documented in notes in the index.html and style.css files.
